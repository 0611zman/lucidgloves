# Controller mounting help for Reverb G2 controllers

Hello!
Due to the massive ring on the Reverb G2 controllers, I added a hook on top on the controller holder to secure your controller during intense gameplay.
The mount is more than tight enough for causal gameplay/testing however I would reccomd using the method listed below for fast moving/intense gameplay.

In order to accoumplish this, simply insert the controller into the mount upside down then, with the ring facing left or right (find which way devides the wieght better for your gloves) wthen rap the string around the ring right above the trigger, now just slide the end onto the hook on the motel. The model has a hook facing both ways so you will NOT need to mirror the model before printing. 
Please refer to the image below.

The mount can also support the controllers when they are inserted when the buttons are facing up, however I had a better tracking experance when the controller was upside down. Your millage may varry depending on how your gloves are built.

If you have any issues with the mount please tag "0611zman" in the discord server and I will help you find a solution. Thank you!
